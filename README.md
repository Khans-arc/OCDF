# Word Page Number Overlay

This is a minimalist floating overlay app that shows the current page/total pages of your active Microsoft Word document.

I built this as a fun, slightly OCD-driven coding project because I wanted to see my Word page number clearly and always on top, without needing to squint at the bottom bar.

- Live page number display (e.g. `3/12`)
- Always stays on top of other windows
- Draggable black overlay with clean white text
- Updates every half second

Itâ€™s a vibe project, just because I wanted it.
